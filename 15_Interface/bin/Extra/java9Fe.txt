Q0From Java 9 onwards, interfaces can contain the following also:

1>Static methods
2>Private methods
3>Private Static methods
ChatGPT
Yes, starting from Java 9, interfaces can contain more than just abstract method declarations. They can include the following types of methods:

1]Static Methods:
--------------
•Interfaces can now have static methods, which are associated with the interface itself rather than with instances of the interface. These methods can be called using the interface name.

interface MyInterface {
    static void myStaticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static method in interface");
    }
}

You can then call the static method like this:

MyInterface.myStaticMethod();

2]Private Methods:

•Java 9 introduced the concept of private methods in interfaces. These methods can be used to break down complex logic into smaller, more manageable pieces without exposing them to the outside world.

interface MyInterface {
    default void myPublicMethod() {
        // Some public logic
        myPrivateMethod();
    }

    private void myPrivateMethod() {
        System.out.println("Private method in interface");
    }
}
The private method myPrivateMethod is only accessible within the interface.

3]Private Static Methods:

Similar to private instance methods, Java 9 also allows interfaces to have private static methods. These methods are useful for code organization and can be used by other methods within the same interface.

interface MyInterface {
    static void myPublicStaticMethod() {
        // Some public static logic
        myPrivateStaticMethod();
    }

    private static void myPrivateStaticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Private static method in interface");
    }
}

The private static method myPrivateStaticMethod is only accessible within the interface and can be used by other static methods defined in the same interface.

These additions provide more flexibility and code organization capabilities when working with interfaces in Java.
